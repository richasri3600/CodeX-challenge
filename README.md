# CodeX-challenge
It is part of resume project challenge held by codebasics.
In this challenge, I worked on a real-world case study for CodeX, a German beverage company aiming to establish its presence in the Indian market. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ The objective was to analyze survey results from 10 cities where they launched their energy drink, and derive meaningful insights to drive actions for the Marketing team.

Using MySQL and Power BI, I delved into the data and uncovered valuable insights that can help the team increase brand awareness, market share, and guide product development. It was an incredible opportunity to apply my skills in data analysis and visualization to solve a practical problem.
